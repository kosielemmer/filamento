# Conversation Summary

## Progress Made
1. Discussed the need to populate the `.env` file with environment variables.
2. Attempted to review `app.py` to determine required environment variables.
3. Identified potential environment variables based on partial information:
   - DB_USER
   - DB_PASSWORD
   - DB_HOST
   - DB_DATABASE

## Issues Encountered
1. Difficulty in adding the contents of `app.py` to the chat for review.
2. Unable to confirm the exact environment variables needed due to lack of access to full `app.py` content.

## Next Steps
1. Successfully add the contents of `app.py` to the chat for review.
2. Confirm the exact environment variables required by the application.
3. Create or update the `.env` file with the necessary variables.

## Note
This summary is based on partial information. A full review of `app.py` is needed to provide accurate advice on environment variables.
